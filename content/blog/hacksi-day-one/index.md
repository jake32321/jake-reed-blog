One of my most favorite times of year is back! I traveled down to Southern Illinois (Carbondale) to volunteer at one of the best hackathons I get to be a part of, HackSI. I got into Carbondale Friday night and spent time walking around the town of my alma mater.  Even though it's only been a year since I have been down here, it feels like it has been a lot longer than that. 

### Morning of Day One 
I forgot how much of a morning person I am not. Getting up at 5:00 AM was rough. Once I had some coffee in me, it was a little better.

Time to get ready for the hackers to arrive! Dav's opening talk was great as always and it seems everyone was more than ready for the day to start!

### Rest of the Day 
The rest of the day was pretty fun. I spent most of the day assisting with the 3D printers. I took some pretty sweet time lapses to boot!<br><br>
