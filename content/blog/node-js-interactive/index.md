## The Trip

Woo! The day I have waited for for months now is finally here! I started out the trip getting into Montréal the night before at around 10 p.m. It was a long trip and I was more than ready to turn in for the night (The hotel is nice though!). 

## Day #1

Good morning Montréal! Even though I didn't sleep much the night before, I was more than ready to get the day started. Being tired isn't something coffee can't help anyways. Anyways, off to the convention center! 

Montréal is wicked cold this time of year. I would say it reminds me a lot of Chicago winter weather which is cold beyond belief and _super_ windy. With only a ten to fifteen minute walk I can't complain much.
