## The Trip

Woo! The day I have waited for for months now is finally here! I started out the trip getting into Montr√©al the night before at around 10 p.m. It was a long trip and I was more than ready to turn in for the night (The hotel is nice though!). 

## Day #1

Good morning Montr√©al! Even though I didn't sleep much the night before, I was more than ready to get the day started. Being tired isn't something coffee can't help anyways. Anyways, off to the convention center! 

Montr√©al is wicked cold this time of year. I would say it reminds me a lot of Chicago winter weather which is cold beyond belief and _super_ windy. With only a ten to fifteen minute walk I can't complain much.

The first day at the conference opens with a gathering in the lobby outside of where the opening keynote would take place. I met Nick Nisi who is one of the hosts of JS Party, a podcast about everything JavaScript (you can follow them here [@JSPartyFM](https://twitter.com/JSPartyFM)). 

_It's time for the keynote!_

The keynote opens with a message from Robin Bender Ginn who is the executive director of the OpenJS foundation. During the opening talk we were given updates of the state of JavaScript and community updates. This showed that JavaScript if the top language on RedMonk and the most popular language on GitHub by repository contributors! Other noteworthy news included the introduction of a Node.js certification program and welcoming Electron into the OpenJSFoundation! üéâ Other keynotes included _The Future of JavaScript is Universal_ - Myles Borins, a detailed overview of the Node.js certification program, making your opensource project foundation ready, and (possibly my favorite keynote of the morning) Ellie Galloway's Jewelbots demo!

_On to the talks!_

After the keynote it's time for some talks! On tried to make it to as many talks as possible. This included everything from making the most of your experience with Node.js to implementing Kubernetes into your application.
